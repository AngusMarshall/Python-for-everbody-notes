#This assignment is for finding the average of a line in a file.
 
#This starts with and input for the file name and opening the file
fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
#here is the line count and total this will be used for calculating the average 
linecount = 0
total = 0
#for loop find what we are looking for in the file
for line in fh:
#narrow it down to the text "X-DSPAM-Confidence:"
    if line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):
    #Then norrow it down futher to finding the 0
        text = line.find("0")
      #convert the number found to a float
        number = float(line[text:])
      #start counting how many lines of "X-DSPAM-Confidence:" there are
        linecount = linecount + 1
      #create a variable called total to get the total amount of numbers from the "X-DSPAM-Confidence:" line
        total = total + number
#avg to calculate the average         
avg = total/linecount
#printing the average
print("Average spam confidence:",avg)
