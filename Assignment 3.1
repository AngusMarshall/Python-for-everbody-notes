#This assignment is to calculate gross pay and over time
#Create two input variables
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter rate:")
#convert the inputs to a floating point
h = float(hrs)
r = float(rate)
#if loop to calculate the pay
#if hours worked if greater than 40 reg(regular pay is hours * rate) ot(over time is number of hours minus 40 times then times by the over time rate of (rate time 0.5)
#else its is normal time
if h > 40:
    reg = h * r
    ot = (h - 40) * (r * 0.5)
    pay = reg + ot
else:
    pay = h * r

print (pay)
