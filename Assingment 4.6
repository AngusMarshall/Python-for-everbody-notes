#This assignment is for creating functions in python
#A calculate pay function is created that calculates pay

#Function compute pay is created with the variables h and r for hours and rate
def computepay(h, r):
#if hours is greater than 40, pay is now at 1.5 times rate then times the hour value after removing 40 from it plus 40* rate
    if h > 40:
        p = 1.5 * r * (h - 40) + (40* r)
#else normal rate        
    else:
        p = h * r
    return p    
    
#variables to prompt user for rates and hours then converting them to floats
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
h = float(hrs)
rate = input("Enter pay rate")
r = float(rate)

#variable to call the function and then printing a string saying "Pay" and then the variable
pay = computepay(h, r)
print("Pay", pay)
